# Smart Calculator

We realise that project using _**generic programming**_ in Java. 
In order to compute, we convert the numbers from infix notation to postfix notation.   

The reason to convert infix to postfix expression is that we can compute 
the answer of postfix expression easier by using a stack since we can have 
an expresion like this :
- 3 + 8 * ((4 + 3) * 2 + 1) - 6 / (2 + 1)
- a\*2+b\*3+c*(2+3).
